# Model Deployment with Streamlit on Streamlit Public Cloud
In this repository, we demonstrate the deployment of an XGBoost model using Streamlit, a popular Python library for building interactive web applications, and hosting it on Streamlit Public Cloud.

### Steps to Deploy the Model
1. Export the XGBoost Model
We first export our trained XGBoost model into a pickle file named xgb_classifier.pkl. This file contains the serialized version of our model, ready for deployment.

2. Create the Streamlit UI
We develop the user interface for our model using Streamlit in a Python script named app1.py. This script defines the input parameters that the model expects from the user and generates the model output accordingly.

3. Set Up GitHub Repository
We create a GitHub repository to manage our code and files related to the deployment process. This repository serves as the central hub for version control and collaboration.

4. Connect GitHub Repo to Streamlit Public Cloud
We connect our GitHub repository to Streamlit's public cloud platform. This integration allows us to deploy our Streamlit application directly from our GitHub repository.

5. Deploy Model on Streamlit Public Cloud
We deploy our Streamlit application, along with our XGBoost model, on Streamlit Public Cloud. The deployment process is seamless, and our application becomes accessible via a public URL.

## Usage
To use the deployed model:

Visit the deployed Streamlit application URL.
Input the required parameters as prompted by the user interface.
Click on the relevant buttons or interact with the interface elements to generate model predictions.
View the model output displayed on the Streamlit UI.
